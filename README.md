**FOLLOW ALL DIRECTIONS CAREFULLY**

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, download and install Java using one of these links:
> Windows: https://download.oracle.com/java/17/archive/jdk-17.0.1_windows-x64_bin.exe

> Mac OS: https://download.oracle.com/java/17/archive/jdk-17.0.1_macos-x64_bin.dmg

Also, you need to launch Minecraft version 1.8.8 before installing EggClient.

## Windows Guide

Once that's installed, head on over to my Discord Server (https://discord.gg/4NEyZG4uvB) and in Bot Commands, type the command `/get eggclient`, it will then request me to approve your download. This might take a few hours, but I should be able to approve (or deny) it in less than 24 hours. Once you get approved and you got the file,

(it is in DMs with the Eggo bot) you should download the file by clicking the `Download EggClient` button. You should get an EggClient.zip file. Go to where the EggClient.zip was installed, and extract it by right-clicking (EggClient.zip) and click "Extract" or "Extract All"

After that's done, you should get a folder named EggClient. Right click that folder and click 'copy'. We'll need that for later. Now we have to get to the .minecraft folder. On a Windows computer, do `Windows Key + R`. This will open 
the Run application. Then, search `%appdata%`. Click Ok. Then open the .minecraft folder. After that, scroll down and open the "versions" folder. Inside the versions folder, paste the EggClient folder we copied earlier.
## Load in Minecraft Launcher
Open your Minecraft Launcher. On the top bar, click Installations. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92561247/153734002-7d544533-96f8-4a93-b8b7-2adc482ac3c5.png). Then click the "New Installation" button. Name your installation whatever you want, then on the Version, scroll down until you see `Release EggClient`. Click that. On the bottom of this menu, you should see the button for "More Options". Click that, and in Java Executable, put in `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17.0.1\bin\javaw.exe`. Now, press the Green "Create" button on the bottom right. You should now be able to see the Option for EggClient in the Play Menu. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92561247/153734116-a5dc5943-2a72-45fd-ab20-7e81d7cc0961.png) Now click Play and you should be able to launch the game!
