# Installation Guide
`Video and MacOS Guide Coming Soon!ðŸŽ¥`

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, download and install Java using one of these links:
> Windows: https://download.oracle.com/java/17/archive/jdk-17.0.1_windows-x64_bin.exe

> Mac OS: https://download.oracle.com/java/17/archive/jdk-17.0.1_macos-x64_bin.dmg

Also, you need to launch Minecraft version 1.8.8 before installing EggClient.

## Windows Guide

Once that's installed, go to my Github page (https://github.com/uhEgg/EggClient) and download the "EggClient.zip" file by clicking on this: 
![Github Site](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uhEgg/EggClient/main/github%20download.png)
and then ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92561247/153733785-a0dbc45f-f708-467f-8b92-93d9af9aa4f0.png)
Go to where the EggClient.zip was installed, and extract it by right-clicking (EggClient.zip) and click "Extract" or "Extract All"

After that's done, you should get a folder named EggClient. Right click that folder and click 'copy'. We'll need that for later. Now we have to get to the .minecraft folder. On a Windows computer, do `Windows Key + R`. This will open 
the Run application. Then, search `%appdata%`. Click Ok. Then open the .minecraft folder. After that, scroll down and open the "versions" folder. Inside the versions folder, paste the EggClient folder we copied earlier.
## Load in Minecraft Launcher
Open your Minecraft Launcher. On the top bar, click Installations. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92561247/153734002-7d544533-96f8-4a93-b8b7-2adc482ac3c5.png). Then click the "New Installation" button. Name your installation whatever you want, then on the Version, scroll down until you see `Release EggClient`. Click that. On the bottom of this menu, you should see the button for "More Options". Click that, and in Java Executable, put in `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17.0.1\bin\javaw.exe`. Now, press the Green "Create" button on the bottom right. You should now be able to see the Option for EggClient in the Play Menu. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92561247/153734116-a5dc5943-2a72-45fd-ab20-7e81d7cc0961.png) Now click Play and you should be able to launch the game!
